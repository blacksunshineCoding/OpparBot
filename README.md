# OpparBot
A Twitter Bot that tweets poems from a JSON File every hour (CronJob) based on TwitterOAuth

# TwitterOAuth (by Abraham)
The Twitter API Part is fully based on TwitterOAuth from abraham. Everything in the folder "twitteroauth-master" belongs to abraham and is part of his TwitterOAuth Repository! Only the files outside this folder are my work!
